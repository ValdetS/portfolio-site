                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>Card Fu is a capstone project I made. Card Fu is a turn based strategy fighting game, that
                    incorporates machine learning and artificial intelligence. This capstone project was an oppurtunity
                    for me to try out new technologies, and step outside my comfort zone. I decided to explore artifical
                    intelligence, and thought it would fit in well with an idea I had, Card Fu.</p>

                <p>The concept of Card Fu is similar to rock, paper, scissors. Where one type of move is more effective
                    than another type, so on and so forth. The player would play the game facing others online or
                    computers offline. That is where AI makes a great component to this game. Having an opponent that
                    learns your play style, really helps scale the difficulty of the game as you progress and earn new
                    moves.</p>

                <p>The big challenges I faced with this project are, that it was my first time attempting game
                    development and working with AI. Already the project seemed daunting and I hadn't even started
                    yet. Thankfully through the ideation of the project, I was able to make the problem at hand
                    manageable. I decided to only focus on the AI component of the game, which resulted in me creating a
                    playable demo of the game. That is what this capstone project is.</p>

                <p>This project was possible thanks to <a href="https://unity.com/" title="Visit https://unity.com/"
                        target="_blank" class="ref-link">Unity</a> and their <a
                        href="https://unity.com/products/machine-learning-agents"
                        title="Visit https://unity.com/products/machine-learning-agents" target="_blank"
                        class="ref-link">ML-Agents Toolkit</a>. As someone with no prior experience in game development
                    or AI tech, having these tools available made dealing with those technologies much easier.</p>

                <p>Unity is a popular choice for game development, which means there are tons of tutorials about it out
                    there. On top of that they also have alot of documentation and guides that you can follow
                    to learn. This made programming in C# more approachable, and increasing the possibility of completing my
                    project.</p>

                <p>Unity's ML-Agnets Toolkit was the key to incorporating machine learning and aritficial intelligence
                    to my project. With it I was able to create my very first AI neural network. I taught the AI how to
                    play my game and then trained it to play the game effectively.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                <p>Card Fu is more than just a demo for an idea. Card Fu is a representation of my ability to learn new
                    technologies. It is the result of me seeing an opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and taking
                    it. Although just being a small piece of a larger idea, Card Fu is a project that is special to me.
