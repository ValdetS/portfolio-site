                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>We Save On Power is a sales funnel website I made. The site offers a small quiz to filter
                    people for potential customers. If the conversion is successful and the customer signs up,
                    they are then contacted by a sales person.</p>

                <p>This project is actual freelance work that I did for a client. The website is a companion piece to their ad campaign. The goal for this project was to update their existing sales funnel, and try to make it as effective as possible.</p>

                <h2>Key Components</h2>
                <p>On the surface there doesn't seem to be any peculiar aspects to the project, it's just a simple website. Although the different elements that make up the website are not so simple. When you isolate and study them. It really shows how important graphic and UX/UI design are.</p>

                <p>The apperance of things, the tone of the website, the flow of the user journey. These concepts have alot of depth to them. The ideation of them is tedious but necessary. Especially in the case for a sales funnel. Having an attractive product is an incentive for someone to check out your buisness, but your website is what gives them a reason to buy.</p>

                <p>For this project, I had to make sure that the website presented itself as professional, the design of the user flow to be streamlined and encouraging, and most importantly, making sure it worked.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>We Save On Power was a learning experience for me. The project was simple although the process to complete it, not so much. This was the first time I had to apply my skills in a professional setting. Being in that enviroment exposed me to different perspectives and is what helped me learn various things. Such as, working with others is fun, working with others remotely is a challenge.</p>
